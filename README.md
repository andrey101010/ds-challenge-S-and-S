## Requirements:

- pyenv with Python: 3.9.4

### Setup

Use the requirements file in this repo to create a new environment.

```BASH
make setup

#or

pyenv local 3.9.8
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries needed for deployment.. of model or dashboard .. thus no jupyter or other libs used during development.

The MLFLOW URI should **not be stored on git**, you have two options, to save it locally in the `.mlflow_uri` file:

```BASH
echo http://127.0.0.1:5000/ > .mlflow_uri
```

This will create a local file where the uri is stored which will not be added on github (`.mlflow_uri` is in the `.gitignore` file). Alternatively you can export it as an environment variable with

```bash
export MLFLOW_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

This links to your local mlflow, if you want to use a different one, then change the set uri.

The code in the [config.py](modeling/config.py) will try to read it locally and if the file doesn't exist will look in the env var.. IF that is not set the URI will be empty in your code.



In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python modeling/predict.py models/linear data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv
```
